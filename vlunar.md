# Privacy Policy

**vLunar** is designed with privacy in mind. The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us.

## Data Collection

- No personal information collected by the app
- No usage analytics or tracking
- No accounts or registration required

## External Services

vLunar uses Sentry for anonymous crash reporting to help improve app stability:

- **Sentry** (sentry.io)

Crash reports may include device type, OS version, and app state at the time of a crash. No personally identifiable information is collected. You can review Sentry's privacy policy at
https://sentry.io/privacy/.

## Local Data

- Lunar date calculations are performed entirely on your device using Apple's Calendar framework
- Solar terms and holiday data are bundled with the app
- Preferences (menubar display style, launch at login) are stored locally using UserDefaults
- No data is sent to us or any server we operate

## Calendar Access

vLunar does not access your personal calendar data. All lunar date calculations are based on the current system date and use Apple's built-in Chinese calendar algorithms.

## Network Permission

vLunar requires network access (`com.apple.security.network.client`) solely for:
- Sending anonymous crash reports to Sentry when errors occur

The core calendar functionality works entirely offline.
