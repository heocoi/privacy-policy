# Privacy Policy

**Signal Peek** does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## Data Collection

- No personal information collected
- No usage analytics or tracking
- No third-party services

## Location Permission

Signal Peek requests Location permission because macOS requires it to access WiFi information through CoreWLAN. This is an Apple system requirement, not a choice by the app.

**Important:** Signal Peek does not actually use your location. It only uses the permission to read WiFi signal data (SSID, signal strength, channel, etc.) from your Mac's wireless interface.

## Local Data

- WiFi metrics are read directly from your Mac's hardware and displayed locally
- Preferences (display format, refresh interval) are stored locally using UserDefaults
- No data leaves your device
