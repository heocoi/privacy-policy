# Privacy Policy

**TranslatePeek** is designed with privacy in mind. The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All processing happens entirely offline on your device.

## Data Collection

- No personal information collected by the app
- No usage analytics or tracking
- No accounts or registration required
- No internet connection required or used

## Local Processing

TranslatePeek uses Apple's built-in frameworks to perform all operations locally:

- **Screen Capture**: Captured images are processed in memory only and never saved to disk
- **Text Recognition**: Uses Apple Vision framework running entirely on-device
- **Translation**: Uses Apple Translation framework with offline language models

No captured content, recognized text, or translations are ever transmitted anywhere.

## Local Data

- Preferences (target language, keyboard shortcut, menu bar icon, sound settings) are stored locally using UserDefaults
- No data is sent to us or any server

## Screen Recording Permission

TranslatePeek requires Screen Recording permission (`NSScreenCaptureUsageDescription`) to capture the selected region of your screen. This permission is used solely for the app's core functionality. Captured content exists only in temporary memory and is discarded immediately after translation.

## No Network Access

TranslatePeek has no network entitlements and cannot connect to the internet. The app is completely offline by design.
